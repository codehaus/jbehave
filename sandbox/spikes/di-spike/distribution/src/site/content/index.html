<h2>What is JBehave?</h2>
<p>JBehave is a framework for <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_driven_development">Behaviour-Driven
Development</a> (BDD). BDD is an evolution of test-driven development (TDD)
and acceptance-test driven design, and is intended to make these
practices more accessible and intuitive to newcomers and experts alike.
It shifts the vocabulary from being test-based to behaviour-based, and
positions itself as a design philosophy.</p>

<p>Features of JBehave include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Pure Java implementation, which plays well with Java-based
    enterprises</li>
    <li>Allows users to specify and run text-based scenarios, which
    allows "out-in" development.</li>
    <li>Annotation-based binding of textual steps to Java methods</li>
    <li>Auto-conversion of string arguments to any parameter type
    (including generic types) via custom parameter converters.</li>
    <li>Scenario reporter - outputs scenarios executed in
    human-readable form</li>
    <li>Auto-generation of pending steps so the build is not broken
    by a missing step, but has option to configure breaking build for
    pending steps.</li>
    <li>Scenario can be run as JUnit tests, providing easy
    integration with your favourite IDE. Using alternative
    annotation-based unit test frameworks is equally easy.</li>
    <li>Ant integration: allows scenarios to be run via Ant task</li>
    <li>Maven integration: allows scenarios to be run via Maven
    plugin at given build phase</li>
</ul>
