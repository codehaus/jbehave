<h1 class="FirstChild">About JBehave</h1>

h2. JBehave is a framework for Behaviour Driven Development

Behaviour-driven development (BDD) is an evolution of test-driven
development (TDD) and is designed to make TDD more accessible and
intuitive to newcomers and experts alike.

It shifts the vocabulary from being test-based to behaviour-based,
and positions itself as a <em>design</em> philosophy.

You can find out more about behaviour-driven development on
"the BDD wiki":http://behaviour-driven.org.

h2. Warning

JBehave is currently in heavy development while "the team":team.html
works towards a stable 1.0 release. We don't currently
recommend its use in production projects but would be grateful if
developers try out the latest "development snapshot":download.html#snapshot
or a version straight from the "repository":repository.html
and send us feedback.

Announcements of development releases as well as alpha, beta and
final releases of version 1.0 will be sent to the "mailing lists":mailing-lists.html.
