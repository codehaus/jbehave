h1. Golden Rules

Here are some rules that we follow when developing JBehave:

* **Behaviour Driven:** Never check in a class without an associated Behaviour Class.
* **Behaviour Always Valid:** Never check any failing behaviour into the repository.

h1. Development Resources

        <td>Instructions on how to contribute to the project.  We welcome
        all sorts of contributions including patches, code, documentation,
