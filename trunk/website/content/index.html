<h1>About JBehave</h1>

<h2>JBehave is a framework for Behaviour Driven Development</h2>

<p>Behaviour-driven development (BDD) is an evolution of test-driven
development (TDD) and is designed to make TDD more accessible and
intuitive to newcomers and experts alike.</p>

<p>It shifts the vocabulary from being test-based to behaviour-based,
and positions itself as a <em>design</em> philosophy.</p>
<p>You can find out more about behaviour-driven development on <a
	href="http://behaviour-driven.org">the BDD wiki</a>.</p>

<h2>Warning</h2>

<p>JBehave is currently in heavy development while <a href="team.html">the
team</a> works towards a stable 1.0 release. We don't currently
recommend its use in production projects but would be grateful if
developers try out the latest <a href="download.html#snapshot">development
snapshot</a> or a version straight from the <a href="repository.html">repository</a>
and send us feedback.</p>

<p>Announcements of development releases as well as alpha, beta and
final releases of version 1.0 will be sent to the <a
	href="mailing-lists.html">mailing lists</a>.</p>
