<p>JBehave is a framework for <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_driven_development">Behaviour-Driven
Development</a> (BDD). BDD is an evolution of test-driven development (TDD)
and acceptance-test driven design, and is intended to make these
practices more accessible and intuitive to newcomers and experts alike.
It shifts the vocabulary from being test-based to behaviour-based, and
positions itself as a design philosophy.</p>

<p>You can find out more about behaviour-driven development on <a
    href="http://behaviour-driven.org/">behaviour-driven.org</a>.
Newcomers are encouraged to start from <a
    href="http://behaviour-driven.org/Introduction">Introducing BDD</a>.</p>

<p>Features of JBehave include:
<ul>
    <li>Pure Java implementation, which plays well with Java-based enterprises</li>
    <li>Allows users to specify and run text-based scenarios, which 
    allows "out-in" development.</li>
    <li>Annotation-based binding of textual steps to Java methods</li>
    <li>Auto-conversion of string arguments to any
    parameter type (including generic types) via custom parameter
    converters.</li>
    <li>Scenario reporter - outputs scenarios executed in
    human-readable form</li>
    <li>Auto-generation of pending steps so the build is not broken
    by a missing step, but has option to configure breaking build for pending steps.</li>
    <li>Scenario can be run as JUnit tests, providing easy
    integration with your favourite IDE.  Using alternative annotation-based
    unit test frameworks is equally easy.</li>
    <li>Ant integration: allows scenarios to be run via Ant task</li>
    <li>Maven integration: allows scenarios to be run via Maven
    plugin at given build phase</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The reference documentation is primarily to provide a reference development guide
for each release. More dynamic information can be found in <a href="http://jbehave.org">JBehave wiki</a>.</p>
