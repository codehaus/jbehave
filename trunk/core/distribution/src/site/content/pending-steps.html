<h2>Pending Steps</h2>

<p>By default, JBehave does not fail with it encounters steps that
do not match any method in the Steps class. These are called <b>pending</b>
steps. This is because it is designed to allow scenario writers to write
the textual scenario before the implementation (hence the
behaviour-driven development). By marking a step as pending, it's
telling the scenario writer that it's not yet implemented and
correspondingly it will not execute any steps that following in the same
scenario.</p>

<p>In some cases, thought, it may be useful to make the scenarios
fail when steps are pending. This is done by configuring the <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/scenario/errors/PendingErrorStrategy.html">PendingErrorStrategy</a>
in <a href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/scenario/Configuration.html">Configuration</a></p>
<pre class="brush: java">
new Configuration(){
   public PendingErrorStrategy forPendingSteps() {
       return PendingErrorStrategy.FAILING;
   }
} 
</pre>
