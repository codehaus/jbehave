<h2>Pending Steps</h2>

<p>JBehave is designed to allow textual scenarios to be written
before the implementation, i.e. to let the specification of the
behaviour drive the development. For this reason, with steps that do not
match any method in the Steps class, which are called <b>pending
steps</b>, it does not fail by default. By marking a step as pending, it's
simply telling the scenario writer that it's not yet implemented and
correspondingly it will not execute any steps that following in the same
scenario.</p>

<p>In some cases, thought, it may be useful to make the scenarios
fail when steps are pending. The behaviour is controlled by configuring
the <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/scenario/errors/PendingErrorStrategy.html">PendingErrorStrategy</a>
via the Scenario <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/scenario/Configuration.html">Configuration</a></p>
<pre class="brush: java">
new Configuration(){
   public PendingErrorStrategy forPendingSteps() {
       return PendingErrorStrategy.FAILING;
   }
} 
</pre>
