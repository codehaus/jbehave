Title: The Glyph Moves As Time Passes
As a game player
I want the glyph to move downwards as time passes
So that the game is a challenge

Scenario: The Player Sees The First Glyph Moves
Given Hellbound is running
When the player starts the game
Then the first glyph should be displayed in the pit
And when time passes
Then the glyph should move downwards
