    <h1>Two minute tutorial</h1>

    <p>You create a Behaviour Class, which is a plain Java class which by convention
    has the name of the class whose behaviour we are specifying followed
    by the word "Behaviour", so <tt>Foo</tt> has <tt>FooBehaviour</tt>.<br/></p>

	<p>Inside the Behaviour Class are a bunch of responsibilities that specify the
	behaviour we expect. These are just public void methods that start with "should"
	and which describe the specific behaviour (e.g. <tt>CustomerServiceBehaviour</tt>
	might have <tt>shouldFindCustomerBySurname()</tt>).</p>
	
	<p>These will typically set up a known environment, execute some behaviour and
	then verify that stuff happened. There are some static methods in
	<tt>jbehave.framework.Verify</tt> that help with this, for instance
	<tt>Verify.that(somethingHappened)</tt> and <tt>Verify.equal(expectedValue, actualValue)</tt>.</p>

	<p>Our template responsibility method looks like this:</p>
	<div class="Shaded"><pre>
public void should[DoSomething]() {
	// setup
	
	// execute
	
	// verify
}
	</pre></div>
	<p>The <tt>DoSomething</tt> is highlighted so we know we have to change it to actually
	describe a responsibility. Templates are nice like that.</p>
	
	<p>Behaviour classes can be contained in, wait for it, a behaviour class container.
	This is a plain Java class that implements the <tt>jbehave.framework.SpecContainer</tt>
	interface. This has a single method: <tt>getBehaviourClasses()</tt>, which returns an
	array of <tt>Class</tt> objects representing the behaviour classes to run. Naturally
	behaviour class containers can contain other behaviour class containers.</p>

	<p>Behaviour classes and responsibilities are verified by reflecting into the behaviour
	classes and invoking the responsibility methods. A Listener is notified whenever something
	interesting happens.</p>

	<p>A single responsibility is verified by a <tt>ResponsibilityVerifier</tt>, a behaviour class
	is verified by a <tt>BehaviourClassVerifier</tt></p>

	<p>So how do we tie this all together? There is a small <tt>main</tt> method inside
	<tt>jbehave.framework.Run</tt> that takes a behaviour class name as its argument and invokes a
	<tt>BehaviourVerifier</tt> on it passing in a <tt>TextListener</tt>. Run that with
	<tt>jbehave-core.jar</tt> on your classpath. And, um, that's it. So:</p>

	<div class="Shaded">
		<pre>java -cp jbehave.jar;your_classpath jbehave.framework.Run your.ApplicationBehaviour</pre>
	</div>

  </body>
