<h2>Pending Steps</h2>

<p>JBehave is designed to allow textual scenarios to be written
before the implementation, i.e. to let the specification of the
behaviour drive the development. For this reason, with steps that do not
match any method in the Steps class, which are called <b>pending
steps</b>, it does not fail by default. By marking a step as pending, it's
simply telling the scenario writer that it's not yet implemented and
correspondingly it will not execute any steps that following in the same
scenario.</p>

<p>In some cases, thought, it may be useful to make the scenarios
fail when steps are pending. The behaviour is controlled by configuring
the <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/scenario/errors/PendingErrorStrategy.html">PendingErrorStrategy</a>
via the Scenario <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/scenario/Configuration.html">Configuration</a></p>
<pre class="brush: java">
new Configuration(){
   public PendingErrorStrategy forPendingSteps() {
       return PendingErrorStrategy.FAILING;
   }
} 
</pre>

<h2>Dry Run Mode</h2>

<p>It may be sometimes useful to run in dry-run mode, checking if any steps are pending but without actually
executed any of the steps, as this may take a considerable time.  The dry-run mode may be enabled via
the StepsConfiguration:</p>

<pre class="brush: java">
StepsConfiguration stepsConfiguration = new StepsConfiguration();
stepsConfiguration.useMonitor(new PrintStreamStepMonitor()); // default is SilentStepMonitor()
stepsConfiguration.doDryRun(true); // default is "false"
Steps steps = new StepsFactory(stepsConfiguration, new MySteps());
</pre>

<p>We've here configured the steps to use a verbose monitoring, so that the use can see that in dry-run mode 
the step that is about to be performed will be followed by a "(DRY RUN)" additional tag.   When dry-run mode
is activated, it will also be shown in the reporters' output.
