<h2>Table Examples</h2>

<p>Scenario writers often find themselves repeating scenarios, or
parts thereof, by simply changing some parameter values. These are ideal
candidates for using JBehave Table Examples feature. Let's look at the
example:</p>

<pre class="brush: bdd">
    Given a stock of symbol STK1 and a threshold of 10.0
    When the stock is traded at 5.0
    Then the alert status should be OFF
    When the stock is traded at 11.0
    Then the alert status should be ON
</pre>

<p>We notice that two lines are repeated and identical but for the
values. We can then rewrite this scenario as:</p>

<pre class="brush: bdd">
    Given a stock of symbol [symbol] and a threshold of [threshold]
    When the stock is traded at [price]
    Then the alert status should be [status]
    
    Examples: 
    
    |symbol|threshold|price|status|
    |STK1|10.0|5.0|OFF|
    |STK1|10.0|11.0|ON|
</pre>
<p>The <b>Examples:</b> keyword signals that the scenario should be
repeated for as many times as there are data rows in the examples table.
At each execution, the named parameters are taken from the corresponding
row.</p>
<p>One important difference to underline in using table examples is
that they require <a href="parameter-injection.html">named
parameters</a> for the candidate steps to be matched to Java methods. The
named parameters allow the parameters to be injected using the table row
values with the corresponding header name, instead of being extracted
from the annotation pattern match. As such, <b>the step annotation pattern
must hold the verbatim textual step</b>. e.g.:</p>
<pre class="brush: java">
    @Given("a stock of symbol [symbol] and a threshold of [threshold]")
    public void aStock(@Named("symbol") String symbol, @Named("threshold") double threshold) {
        // ...
    }
</pre>
