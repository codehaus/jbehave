<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>JBehave uses <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> to manage its source code.</p>

<h2>Web Access</h2>

<p>The following is a link to the online source repository:</p>

<p><a href="http://svn.codehaus.org/jbehave/trunk/core">http://svn.codehaus.org/jbehave/trunk/core</a></p>

<h2>Developer access</h2>

<p>Everyone can access the Subversion repository via HTTPS, but
Committers must checkout the Subversion repository via HTTPS.</p>

<pre>$ svn checkout https://svn.codehaus.org/jbehave/trunk/core jbehave</pre>
<p>To commit changes to the repository, execute the following
command to commit your changes (svn will prompt you for your password)</p>

<pre>$ svn commit --username your-username -m &quot;A message&quot;</pre>

<h2>Access from behind a firewall</h2>

<p>For those users who are stuck behind a corporate firewall which
is blocking http access to the Subversion repository, you can try to
access it via the developer connection:</p>

<pre>$ svn checkout https://svn.codehaus.org/jbehave/trunk jbehave</pre>

<h2>Access through a proxy</h2>

<p>The Subversion client can go through a proxy, if you configure it
to do so. First, edit your &quot;servers&quot; configuration file to
indicate which proxy to use. The files location depends on your
operating system. On Linux or Unix it is located in the directory
&quot;~/.subversion&quot;. On Windows it is in
&quot;%APPDATA%\Subversion&quot;. (Try &quot;echo %APPDATA%&quot;, note
this is a hidden directory.)</p>

<p>There are comments in the file explaining what to do. If you
don't have that file, get the latest Subversion client and run any
command; this will cause the configuration directory and template files
to be created.</p>

<p>Example: Edit the 'servers' file and add something like :</p>

<pre class="brush: plain">
[global]
http-proxy-host = your.proxy.name
http-proxy-port = 3128
</pre>
