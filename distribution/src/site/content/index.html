<p>jBehave is a framework for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_driven_development">Behaviour-Driven
Development</a> (BDD). BDD is an evolution of test-driven development (TDD) and acceptance-test driven design, and is
intended to make these practices more accessible and intuitive to newcomers and experts alike. It shifts the vocabulary
from being test-based to behaviour-based, and positions itself as a design philosophy.</p>

<p>You can find out more about behaviour-driven development on <a href="http://behaviour-driven.org/">behaviour-driven.org</a>.
Newcomers are encouraged to start from <a href="http://behaviour-driven.org/Introduction">Introducing BDD</a>.</p>

<p>Features of jBehave 2 include:
<ul>
  <li>Scenario runner - runs executable scenarios / acceptance criteria using text-based input, with
  auto-conversion of string arguments to numbers</li>
  <li>Scenario reporter - outputs scenarios executed in human-readable form</li>
  <li>Scenario can be run as JUnit 4 tests, providing easy integration with your favourite IDE</li>
  <li>Scenario steps defined using Java 5 annotations that match the scenarios</li>
  <li>Pending steps auto-generated for which hasn’t been defined yet so the build is not broken by a missing step</li>
  <li>Maven integration – allows scenarios to be run at integration-test build phase</li>
</ul>
