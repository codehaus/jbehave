<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>Our goal with JBehave 2 was to make a framework that was
lightweight, easy to use and overcome some of the usability limitations
of JBehave 1. To that end, we've been driving this entirely from example
code - no guessing, unless it's obvious - and we've ended up with
something that works quite a lot like RSpec's story runner, but for
Java.</p>

<p>To use it, simply name your scenario file with underscores, eg
i_can_toggle_a_cell (although the file name resolution is configurable)
and define steps in it: <textarea class="xml:nogutter:nocontrols"
    name="code">
      Given a 5 by 5 game
      When I toggle the cell at (2, 3)
      Then the grid should look like
      .....
      .....
      .....
      ..X..
      .....
      When I toggle the cell at (2, 4)
      Then the grid should look like
      .....
      .....
      .....
      ..X..
      ..X..
      When I toggle the cell at (2, 3)
      Then the grid should look like
      .....
      .....
      .....
      .....
      ..X..
</textarea> A few more elements are required:
<ul>
    <li>Extend the <a
        href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/scenario/Scenario.html">Scenario</a>
    class with a similarly named Java class: <code>ICanToggleACell.java</code></li>
    <li>Extend the <a
        href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/scenario/steps/Steps.html">Steps</a>
    class - this is where your steps will be defined, and you can have
    as many as you want</li>
    <li>Inject these into the Scenario: <textarea
        class="java:nogutter:nocontrols" name="code">
      public class ICanToggleACell extends Scenario {

        public ICanToggleACell() {
            super(new GridSteps()); // varargs, can have lots of steps
        }
      }
  </textarea></li>
    <li><a
        href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/scenario/annotations/package-summary.html">Annotate</a>
    methods in your step class to match the ones in your plain text
    scenario. <textarea class="java:nogutter:nocontrols" name="code">
      public class GridSteps extends Steps {

        private Game game;
        private StringRenderer renderer;

        @Given("a $width by $height game")
        public void theGameIsRunning(int width, int height) {
            game = new Game(width, height);
            renderer = new StringRenderer();
            game.setObserver(renderer);
        }

        @When("I toggle the cell at ($column, $row)")
        public void iToggleTheCellAt(int column, int row) {
            game.toggleCellAt(column, row);
        }

        @Then("the grid should look like $grid")
        public void theGridShouldLookLike(String grid) {
            ensureThat(renderer.asString(), equalTo(grid));
        }

      }
  </textarea></li>
    <li>Run your new scenario as JUnit test.</li>
    <li>Check out the working <a
        href="https://svn.codehaus.org/jbehave/trunk/examples">examples</a>
    in the source repository.</li>
</ul>

<p>Future features we're thinking of:
<ul>
    <li>tagging scenarios</li>
    <li>better tolerance of whitespace</li>
    <li>an option for pending steps to break the build</li>
    <li>anything you persuade us you need.</li>
</ul>
