<h2>Running Examples with latest snapshot</h2>

<p>JBehave was developed as behaviour and example driven.  As such the examples are 
an integral part of the build, verifying the correctness of the behaviour.  They 
are not released as artifacts, but they can be run easily from source code using Maven</p>

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: plain"><![CDATA[
svn co https://svn.codehaus.org/jbehave/trunk/core
cd core
mvn clean install -Pexamples
]]></script>

<p>The 'examples' profile instructs Maven to build the releasable modules and to verify their
behaviour by running the examples afterwards.</p>

<h2>Running Examples against a fixed version</h2>

<p>In some cases, it may be necessary to run the examples against a known version of JBehave.</p>

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: plain"><![CDATA[
svn co https://svn.codehaus.org/jbehave/trunk/core/examples
cd examples
mvn clean install -Djbehave.version=2.4
]]></script>

<span class="followup">Note that running the examples in 'standalone' mode requires the JBehave parent POM to be present, as it 
contains the information about the development setup of the project, e.g. the compiler, the layout of the source, etc. </span>

<p>To ensure JBehave parent POM is available, two approaches are possible.  One is to check out project source as above and install the parent POM:
</p>

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: plain"><![CDATA[
svn co https://svn.codehaus.org/jbehave/trunk/core
cd core
mvn clean install -N <-- only builds and installs locally top-level parent POM
]]></script>

<p>The other approach is to fetch the parent POM from the snapshots remote repository.  For this, you need to add the 
following profile to your <b>$HOME/.m2/settings.xml</b> 

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: xml"><![CDATA[
<profile>
  <id>codehaus-snapshots</id>
  <repositories>
    <repository>
      <id>codehaus-snapshots</id>
      <url>http://snapshots.repository.codehaus.org</url>
      <snapshots>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
      </snapshots>
      <releases>
        <enabled>false</enabled>
      </releases>
    </repository>
  </repositories>
  <pluginRepositories>
    <pluginRepository>
      <id>codehaus-snapshots</id>
      <url>http://snapshots.repository.codehaus.org</url>
      <snapshots>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
      </snapshots>
      <releases>
        <enabled>false</enabled>
      </releases>
    </pluginRepository>
  </pluginRepositories>
</profile>
]]></script>

<p>and run with additional profile</p>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: plain"><![CDATA[
svn co https://svn.codehaus.org/jbehave/trunk/core/examples
cd examples
mvn clean install -Pcodehaus-snapshots -Djbehave.version=2.4
]]></script>

<span class="followup">As with any Maven artifact that is not expected to change, 
the build or retrieval is only required once, as it will be cached in the local repository. 
So, once you've built the JBehave parent POM from source or retrieved it from the snapshots
repository, you don't need to do it again, unless you think it needs to be updated.</span>

<h2>Running Examples via Ant</h2>

<p>While the basic infrastructure of the build is Maven-based, the examples also show how to run scenarios via Ant.
The <b>trader</b> example has an Ant build.xml which shows its use.  Note that it requires the 
<a href="http://maven.apache.org/ant-tasks">Maven Ant Tasks</a> jar to be present in the <b>$ANT_HOME/lib</b> directory 
in order to retrieve the dependency information from the Maven POM.
