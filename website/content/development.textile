h1(FirstChild). Golden Rules

Here are some rules that we follow when developing JBehave:

* *Behaviour Driven:* Never check in a class without an associated Behaviour Class.
* *Behaviour Always Valid:* Never check any failing behaviour into the repository.

h1. Development Resources

The "team":team.html have written the following documents about development of JBehave.

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th class="Row">"How to contribute":how-to-contribute.html</th>
        <td>Instructions on how to contribute to the project.  We welcome
        all sorts of contributions including patches, code, documentation,
        bug reports and feature requests.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th class="Row">"The Team":team.html</th>
        <td>About the people responsible for JBehave.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

h1. Project Reports

The continuous build process produces the following reports:

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th class="Row"><a href="http://builds.codehaus.org/log/jbehave/">Build Logs</a></th>
        <td>Logs generated by the continuous build process.</td>
      </tr>
