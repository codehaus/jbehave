IMPORTANT 
I strongly suggest visiting http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/blogtxt/ periodically as it is quite likely that I'll have caught some major flaw. Hopefully I'll get them all.

THANKS
I'd like to thank Raoul for permission to use his Simple Recent Comments Plugin v0.1 http://www.raoul.shacknet.nu/ in the functions.php file. I've modified it slightly. Thanks, Raoul.

Ozh, the creator of the WordPress Theme Toolkit, was very generous with his time, and the theme options wouldn't have worked without his help: http://planetOzh.com/.

And also to Elias at http://elias.horribile-dictu.de/ for reminding me that I really should put the recent comments call in a conditional. D'oh! and thanks.
