In order to build the jbehave eclipse feature you need to specify the 
eclipse installation against which you wish to compile.

This is the magic to do:
ant -DeclipseDir=<eclipseInstallDir>

If this is too inconvenient you may also specify the eclipseDir property 
in the build.properties. It currently defaults to c:\Program Files\eclipse.

If you are lucky you will end up with a nice update site in the build/site folder, 
that contains everything you need.

The PDE Junit tests are currently not executed in the build.
