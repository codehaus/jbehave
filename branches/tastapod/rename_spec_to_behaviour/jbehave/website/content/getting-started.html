    <h1>Two minute tutorial</h1>

    <p>You create a Spec, which is a plain Java file which by convention
    has the name of the class whose behaviour we are specifying followed
    by the word "Spec", so <tt>Foo</tt> has <tt>FooSpec</tt>.<br/></p>

	<p>Inside the Spec are a bunch of criteria that specify the behaviour we expect.
    These are just public void methods that start with "should" and which describe
    the specific behaviour (e.g. <tt>CustomerServiceSpec</tt> might have
    <tt>shouldFindCustomerBySurname())</tt>.</p>
	
	<p>These will typically set up a known environment, execute some behaviour and
	then verify that stuff happened. There are some static methods in
	<tt>jbehave.framework.Verify</tt> that help with this, for instance
	<tt>Verify.that(somethingHappened)</tt> and <tt>Verify.equal(expectedValue, actualValue)</tt>.</p>

	<p>Our template criteria looks like this:</p>
	<div class="Shaded"><pre>
public void should[DoSomething]() {
	// setup
	
	// execute
	
	// verify
}
	</pre></div>
	<p>The <tt>DoSomething</tt> is highlighted so we know we have to change it to actually
	describe some criteria. Templates are nice like that.</p>
	
	<p>Specs can be contained in, wait for it, a spec container. This is a plain
	Java class that implements the <tt>jbehave.framework.SpecContainer</tt> interface.
	This has a single method: <tt>getSpecs()</tt>, which returns an array of <tt>Class</tt>
	objects representing the specs to run. Naturally spec containers can contain other
	spec containers.</p>

	<p>Specs and criteria are verified by reflecting into the spec classes and invoking
	the criteria methods. A Listener is notified whenever something interesting happens.</p>

	<p>A single criteria (yes I know, it should be criterion, I'm over it) is verified by a
	<tt>CriteriaVerifier</tt>, a spec is verified by a <tt>SpecVerifier</tt></p>

	<p>So how do we tie this all together? There is a small (2 line) main method inside
	<tt>SpecVerifier</tt> that takes a spec class name as its argument and invokes a
	<tt>SpecVerifier</tt> on it passing in a <tt>TextListener</tt>. Run that with
	<tt>jbehave.jar</tt> on your classpath. And, um, that's it. So:</p>

	<div class="Shaded">
		<pre>java -cp jbehave.jar;your_classpath jbehave.framework.SpecVerifier your.ApplicationSpec</pre>
	</div>

  </body>
