<h2>Warning</h2>
<p>jBehave is currently in heavy development while <a href="team.html">the
team</a> works towards a stable 1.0 release. We don't currently
recommend its use in production projects but would be grateful if
developers try out the latest <a href="download.html#snapshot">development
snapshot</a> or a version straight from the <a href="repository.html">repository</a>
and send us feedback. Announcements of alpha, beta and final releases of version
1.0 will be sent to the <a href="mailing-lists.html">mailing lists</a>.</p>
