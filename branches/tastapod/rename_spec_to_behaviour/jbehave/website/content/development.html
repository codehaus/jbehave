    <h1>Golden Rules</h1>

    <p>Here are some rules that we follow when developing jBehave:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Behaviour Driven:</b>
        Never check in a class without associated Specs and Criteria.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Criteria Always Pass:</b>
        Never check a failing criteria into the repository.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Acceptance Tests Can Fail:</b>
        A failing acceptance test indicates something that needs to be done: a todo item,
        feature request or bug report, for example.
        It's ok to check a failing acceptance test into the CVS repository.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Separate Acceptance Tests:</b>
        Make it easy to run only the Specs so that we can check that they pass
        before committing, even when acceptance tests are failing.
      </li>
    </ul>
