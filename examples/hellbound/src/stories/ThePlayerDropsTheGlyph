Title: The Player Drops The Glyph
As a game player
I want to drop the glyph
So that I can save time

Scenario: The player drops the glyph into an empty pit
Given the first glyph is displayed on the board
And when the player presses the drop button
Then the glyph should fall to the bottom
And then the glyph segments should become junk
And then the next glyph should appear

Scenario: The player drops the glyph onto junk
Given the player drops the glyph into an empty pit
Whe the player presses the drop button
Then the glyph should fall onto the junk
And then the glyph segments should become junk
And then the next glyph should appear
