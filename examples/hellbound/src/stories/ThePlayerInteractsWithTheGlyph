Title: The Player Interacts With The Glyph
As a game player
I want to move the shape
So that I can make space for the next glyph

Scenario: The player moves the glyph
Given the first glyph is displayed on the board
When the player presses the right button
Then the glyph moves right
And when the player presses the left button
Then the glyph moves left
And when the player presses the down button
Then any waiting heartbeat movement is ignored
And then the heartbeat is skipped
And then the glyph moves down

Scenario: The player rotates the glyph left
Given the first glyph is displayed on the board
When the player presses left rotate
Then the glyph turns to one quarter
And when the player presses left rotate
Then the glyph turns to one half
And when the player presses left rotate
Then the glyph turns to three quarters
And when the player presses left rotate
Then the glyph turns to upright

Scenario: The player rotates the glyph right
Given the first glyph is displayed on the board
When the player presses right rotate
Then the glyph turns to three quarters
And when the player presses right rotate
Then the glyph turns to one half
And when the player presses right rotate
Then the glyph turns to one quarter
And when the player presses right rotate
Then the glyph turns to upright
