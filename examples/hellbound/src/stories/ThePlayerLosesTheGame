Title: The Player Loses The Game
As a game player
I want to lose the game
So that the game is a challenge

Scenario: No space for the next glyph
Given that the junk is very high
When the glyph appears
And the player drops it
Then the glyph becomes junk
And the next glyph appears overlapping the junk
And the game is over
