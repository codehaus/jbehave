So then I thought it would be a good idea to write down the next most
important thing(s) jbehave doesn't do. I'm flying back from Jo'burg to the UK
so I guess my holiday-mush-brain is starting to revert to it's work-brain state.
I should have done this all along really...

The Listener 
It should have todo-level failure (Verify.todo()) that records but doesn't break the build
It should have a jMock listener
It should have an adapter to run in a junit test runner
It should have an ant task like <junit>
It should extract the criteria out into English (agiledox)
It should extract the verification out into English for reporting ("Verify that something happened")
