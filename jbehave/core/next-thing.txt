So then I thought it would be a good idea to write down the next most
important thing(s) jbehave doesn't do. I'm flying back from Jo'burg to the UK
so I guess my holiday-mush-brain is starting to revert to it's work-brain state.
I should have done this all along really...

IT SHOULD HAVE A WEBSITE!
DONE. Listener.afterCriteriaVerificationEnds(CriteriaVerefication) should return
  a CriteriaVerification, which the CriteriaVerifier should pass on to the next listener.
  This way the listener could decorate the verification, so that, for instance,
  a JMockListener could fail a verification that had previously succeeded, before it gets
  recorded by a TextListener.
DONE. The method should also take the spec instance as a second parameter (again for JMock) so that
  we can move the spec instance out of the CriteriaVerification (the getSpecInstance()
  method is already deprecated - this would mean we could remove it altogether).
It should have todo-level failure (Verify.todo()) that records but doesn't break the build
It should have a jMock listener (jMock depends on junit for the Assert class - BOO!
It should have an adapter to run in a junit test runner
It should have a <jbehave> ant task like <junit>
It should extract the criteria out into English (agiledox)

Wish list:

It should extract the verification out into English for reporting ("Verify that something happened")
