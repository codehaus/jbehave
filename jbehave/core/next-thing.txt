So then I thought it would be a good idea to write down the next most
important thing(s) jbehave doesn't do. I'm flying back from Jo'burg to the UK
so I guess my holiday-mush-brain is starting to revert to it's work-brain state.
I should have done this all along really...

Verifier should not manage Listeners - it should be constructed with a Listeners (array of Listener)
NOTE: this will likely break the self-verification while we implement it - hmm
It should run itself from a separate jar - this sounds like a custom classloader thing??
Should refactor HashMap anonymous class out of Verifier as MapOfLists with its own Spec
Maybe the Listeners should visit the Criteria?
 - Then everything happens as a side-effect - more event driven
 - Top level Verifier goes away - seems like a Good Thing
It should have todo-level failure (Verify.todo()) that doesn't break the build
It should have a jMock listener
It should be easy to run from inside the IDE
It should have an adapter to run in a junit test runner
It should have an ant task like <junit>
It should have an ant build to create the jar and then run the behaviours
It should extract the criteria out into English (agiledox)
It should extract the verification out into English for reporting ("Verify that something happened")
It should have instance-level verifications for pico-muppets like Hammant :)
