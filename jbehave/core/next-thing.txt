So then I thought it would be a good idea to write down the next most
important thing(s) jbehave doesn't do. I'm flying back from Jo'burg to the UK
so I guess my holiday-mush-brain is starting to revert to it's work-brain state.
I should have done this all along really...

NOTE: Please use http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JBEHAVE for any future ideas,
      and status on these ones. Thanks.

It should have todo-level failure (Verify.todo()) that records but doesn't break the build
It should have a jMock listener (jMock depends on junit for the Assert class - BOO!
It should have an adapter to run in a junit test runner
It should have a <jbehave> ant task like <junit>
It should extract the criteria out into English (agiledox)

Wish list:

It should extract the verification out into English for reporting ("Verify that something happened")
